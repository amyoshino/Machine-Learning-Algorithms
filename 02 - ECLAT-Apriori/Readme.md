# Apriori and ECLAT application to build recommendation system (product allocation strategy)

Trained association rule models (Apriori and ECLAT) to find the most related items bought by customers of a french supermarket during a week. All 7501 lines of the dataset represent items bought by an unique customer, during this week.

The dataset and code are based on a lecture from the course: Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢ by Kirill Eremenko https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/v4/overview. I modified the code to do some transformations and fit data into dataframes to make the visualization easier, and also developed ECLAT algorithm from scratch.

### Apriori:
This algorithm associate products preferences by most of the customers and can be used to generate products recommendation and help on displaying products strategy. 

### ECLAT: 
In this project I implemented the ECLAT algorithm by hand. It calculate the pairs that have been bought more frequently comparing to other pairs. At the end, we expect to see what is the most common combination of products during the week.
